# Advanced LLM Assistant

This project is designed to create a highly optimized assistant powered by Large Language Models (LLM) for specific domains, with efficiency improvements for real-time response and accurate answers from integrated databases.

## Project Structure

- **data/** - Directory for dataset storage (not included in the repository).
- **models/** - Directory for saved models (not included in the repository).
- **src/** - Main code for the assistant, including data loading, model configuration, API, and utility functions.
- **tests/** - Unit tests for the different components of the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8 or higher). Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Project Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/advanced-llm-assistant.git
   cd advanced-llm-assistant
   ```

2. **Set up directories**:
   Create directories for models and data (if they do not already exist).
   ```bash
   mkdir data models
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file to store any API keys or configuration variables needed for accessing external resources or databases (if required by your application).

### Usage

To start the API server, run:

```bash
python src/api.py
```

This will initialize the assistant, allowing you to interact with it through API endpoints (designed with FastAPI).

### Directory Details

- **`src/data_loader.py`** - Functions for loading and preprocessing data from different sources.
- **`src/model.py`** - Model loading and configuration for the assistant’s language model.
- **`src/retriever.py`** - Code for integrating with vector databases, allowing the assistant to fetch relevant information quickly.
- **`src/api.py`** - API server for handling requests to the assistant.
- **`src/utils.py`** - Utility functions used across the project.

### Testing

Unit tests are included in the `tests` directory. To run the tests, execute:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```
